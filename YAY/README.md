## ü§î What is `yay`?

`yay` is an AUR (Arch User Repository) helper. The AUR is a community-driven repository for Arch users, containing thousands of packages not available in the official Arch repositories. `yay` helps you search, install, and manage these packages with ease.

> **üí° Tip:** Think of `yay` as a supercharged version of `pacman` that can also access the vast collection of software in the AUR.

## üöÄ `install.sh` - Your Personal Setup Assistant

The `install.sh` script is designed to automate the installation of a curated list of essential tools and applications for developers and power users. It's a great way to get your new Arch Linux system up and running quickly.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before running the script, please ensure you have the following:

*   An active internet connection.
*   `sudo` privileges (you will be prompted for your password).
*   `yay` installed on your system. If you don't have `yay` installed, please refer to the main `README.md` in the parent directory.

### üîê A Note on Security

> **Always review scripts before running them on your system.** While this script is designed to be safe and helpful, it's good practice to understand what a script does before executing it. You can open the `install.sh` file in a text editor to see the commands it will run. This script is transparent and straightforward, but developing a habit of reviewing scripts is a crucial security practice.

### ‚ú® How to Use

1.  **Make the script executable:** This command gives your system permission to run the script.
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

    The script will then ask for your password to install the packages.

### üé® Customizing the `install.sh` Script

You can easily customize the list of packages to be installed. Open the `install.sh` file in a text editor and you will see a variable named `packages`. You can add or remove packages from this list.

For example, to add the `gimp` image editor and remove `go`, you would edit the list like this:

```bash
packages=(
    # ... existing packages
    # "go" # Commented out to prevent installation
    "gimp" # Added to the list of packages to install
)
```

### üì¶ What's Inside? A Look at the Installed Tools

The script installs a variety of tools, grouped by category:

## üéâ Post-Installation Steps

After the script finishes, there are a few things you should do:

1.  **Log out and log back in:** This is necessary for the `zsh` shell to become your default shell.
2.  **Configure `git`:** Set up your name and email for `git` commits:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
    ```
3.  **Explore `zsh` and Oh My Zsh:** Customize your shell prompt, add plugins, and explore the features of `zsh`. You can find the configuration file at `~/.zshrc`. Some popular plugins to consider are:
    *   `zsh-autosuggestions`: Suggests commands as you type based on your history.
    *   `zsh-syntax-highlighting`: Provides syntax highlighting for the command line.

## üß† Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Why use a script to install packages?**
    *   This script helps to automate the process of setting up a new Arch Linux system, saving you time and effort. It also provides a curated list of popular and useful packages for developers.

*   **Can I run the script multiple times?**
    *   Yes, you can run the script multiple times. The script uses the `--needed` flag with `yay`, which means it will only install packages that are not already installed or are outdated.

*   **What if I already have some of these packages installed?**
    *   The script will simply skip the packages that are already installed and up-to-date.

*   **How do I uninstall these packages?**
    *   You can uninstall the packages individually using `yay -Rns <package-name>`.

## ü§î Troubleshooting

*   **Package not found:** If you get a "package not found" error, make sure the package name is correct and available in the official repositories or the AUR.
*   **Installation failed:** If a package fails to install, try installing it manually with `yay -S <package-name>` to see more detailed error messages.
*   **Check the Arch Wiki:** The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is an excellent resource for troubleshooting any issues.
