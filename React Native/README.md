## üö∂ Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install Core Dependencies

First, let's install some essential tools for React Native development.

*   **Node.js and npm:** The core of React Native development. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, and npm is its package manager.
*   **Watchman:** A tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It's used by React Native to automatically reload your app when you make changes to the code.
*   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Required for building Android apps.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed nodejs npm watchman jdk-openjdk
```

### Step 2: Install Android Studio

Android Studio is the official IDE for Android development, and it comes with the Android SDK and other essential tools.

```bash
yay -S android-studio
```

Once installed, launch Android Studio. You will be greeted with a setup wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions, and make sure to install the following components:

*   **Android SDK:** The software development kit for Android.
*   **Android SDK Platform:** The specific version of the Android platform to build your app against.
*   **Android Virtual Device:** For running the Android emulator.

### Step 3: Set up the Android Emulator

1.  **Open Android Studio.**
2.  In the welcome screen, click on **More Actions > AVD Manager**.
3.  Click on **Create Virtual Device**.
4.  Choose a device definition (e.g., Pixel 4) and click **Next**.
5.  Select a system image. It is recommended to use the latest stable version of Android.
6.  Click **Finish**.

Now you can launch the emulator by clicking the green play button in the AVD Manager.

### Step 4: Install React Native CLI and Expo CLI

*   **React Native CLI:** The command-line interface for React Native. It gives you more control over your project, but it also requires more configuration.
*   **Expo CLI:** A framework and a platform for universal React applications. It's easier to get started with, but it has some limitations.

```bash
sudo npm install -g react-native-cli expo-cli
```

### Step 5: Configure Your Editor

We will use Visual Studio Code for this guide.

1.  **Install VS Code:**
    ```bash
    yay -S visual-studio-code-bin
    ```
2.  **Install the React Native Tools extension:**
    *   Open VS Code.
    *   Go to the **Extensions** view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
    *   Search for `React Native Tools` and install the official extension by Microsoft.

## üöÄ Creating Your First React Native App

### With React Native CLI

1.  **Create a new React Native project:**
    ```bash
    npx react-native init MyAwesomeApp
    ```
2.  **Navigate to your new project:**
    ```bash
    cd MyAwesomeApp
    ```
3.  **Start the Metro bundler:**
    ```bash
    npx react-native start
    ```
4.  **Run the app:** Open a new terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android
    ```

### With Expo

1.  **Create a new Expo project:**
    ```bash
    expo init MyAwesomeExpoApp
    ```
2.  **Navigate to your new project:**
    ```bash
    cd MyAwesomeExpoApp
    ```
3.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Backend with Firebase

Firebase is a popular backend-as-a-service platform from Google.

1.  **Install the Firebase CLI:**
    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```
2.  **Create a Firebase project:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Click on **Add project** and follow the instructions.

3.  **Connect your React Native app to Firebase:**
    *   Follow the official [React Native Firebase documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/) to connect your app to Firebase.

## ü§î Troubleshooting

### `react-native` or `expo` command not found

*   **Symptom:** You get a `bash: react-native: command not found` or `bash: expo: command not found` error.
*   **Cause:** The npm global packages are not in your `PATH`.
*   **Solution:** Add `export PATH="$PATH:$(npm get prefix)/bin"` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file and source it.

### Android Emulator Issues

*   **Emulator not starting or running slowly:**
    *   **Symptom:** The emulator fails to start or is very laggy.
    *   **Cause:** KVM may not be set up correctly.
    *   **Solution:** Follow the [Arch Wiki guide for KVM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KVM) to ensure it's properly installed and configured.

### Build and Run Issues

*   **"SDK location not found" error:**
    *   **Symptom:** The build fails with an error about the SDK location.
    *   **Cause:** The `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable is not set.
    *   **Solution:** Add `export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="$HOME/Android/Sdk"` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file and source it.

*   **Gradle issues:**
    *   **Symptom:** The build fails with a Gradle-related error.
    *   **Cause:** This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as a corrupted Gradle cache or a network issue.
    *   **Solution:** Try cleaning the project by running `./gradlew clean` in the `android` directory of your project. You can also try deleting the `~/.gradle` directory to clear the cache.

*   **"Could not connect to development server" error:**
    *   **Symptom:** The app opens on the emulator but shows a red screen with this error.
    *   **Cause:** The emulator is not able to connect to the Metro bundler.
    *   **Solution:** Run `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` in your terminal.

## üí° What's Next?

*   **Learn React Native:** Dive deeper into the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).
*   **Explore Expo:** Learn more about the [Expo platform](https://docs.expo.dev/).
*   **Build a simple app:** Try building a simple app to solidify your knowledge.
