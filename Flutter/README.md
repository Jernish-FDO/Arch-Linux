## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before we begin, please ensure you have the following:

*   A running Arch Linux system.
*   `sudo` privileges.
*   `yay` installed. If not, please refer to the guide in the parent directory.

## üö∂ Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install Core Dependencies

First, let's install some essential tools for Flutter development.

*   `git`: For version control.
*   `curl`: A tool for transferring data with URLs.
*   `unzip`: For extracting zip archives.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git curl unzip
```

### Step 2: Install Flutter SDK

We will install the Flutter SDK from the AUR. This will install Flutter to the `/opt/flutter` directory.

```bash
yay -S flutter
```

After the installation, you need to add Flutter to your `PATH`. The `PATH` is an environment variable that tells your shell where to look for executable files. By adding Flutter to your `PATH`, you can run Flutter commands from any directory.

1.  **Open your shell configuration file:** This is usually `~/.bashrc` for Bash or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh.
2.  **Add the following line to the end of the file:**
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:/opt/flutter/bin"
    ```
3.  **Source your shell configuration file:** This will apply the changes to your current shell session.
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
    ```

### Step 3: Install Android Studio

Android Studio is required for the Android SDK, emulator, and other tools.

```bash
yay -S android-studio
```

Once installed, launch Android Studio. You will be greeted with a setup wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions, and make sure to install the following components:

*   Android SDK
*   Android SDK Platform
*   Android Virtual Device

### Step 4: Set up the Android Emulator

1.  **Open Android Studio.**
2.  In the welcome screen, click on **More Actions > AVD Manager**.
3.  Click on **Create Virtual Device**.
4.  Choose a device definition (e.g., Pixel 4) and click **Next**.
5.  Select a system image. It is recommended to use the latest stable version of Android.
6.  Click **Finish**.

Now you can launch the emulator by clicking the green play button in the AVD Manager.

### Step 5: Configure Your Editor

We will use Visual Studio Code for this guide.

1.  **Install VS Code:**
    ```bash
    yay -S visual-studio-code-bin
    ```
2.  **Install the Flutter extension:**
    *   Open VS Code.
    *   Go to the **Extensions** view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
    *   Search for `Flutter` and install the official extension by Dart Code.
    *   This will also install the `Dart` extension.

### Step 6: Run `flutter doctor`

`flutter doctor` is a command that checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. It's a crucial tool for identifying any issues with your setup.

```bash
flutter doctor
```

A successful output will look something like this:

```
[‚úì] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.x.x, on Arch Linux, locale en_US.UTF-8)
[‚úì] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 33.0.0)
[‚úì] Chrome - develop for the web
[‚úì] Linux toolchain - develop for Linux desktop
[‚úì] Android Studio (version 2022.x)
[‚úì] VS Code (version 1.x)
[‚úì] Connected device (1 available)
[‚úì] HTTP Host Availability
```

If `flutter doctor` reports any issues, it will provide instructions on how to fix them. A common issue is needing to accept the Android licenses. You can do this by running:

```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

## üöÄ Creating Your First Flutter App

1.  **Create a new Flutter project:** The `flutter create` command will create a new directory with a simple demo app.
    ```bash
    flutter create my_awesome_app
    ```
2.  **Navigate to your new project:**
    ```bash
    cd my_awesome_app
    ```
3.  **Run the app:** Make sure your Android emulator is running, then run the following command:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

This will launch your app on the Android emulator. You should see the default Flutter demo app.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Backend with Firebase

Firebase is a popular backend-as-a-service platform from Google.

1.  **Install the Firebase CLI:**
    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```
2.  **Create a Firebase project:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Click on **Add project** and follow the instructions.

3.  **Connect your Flutter app to Firebase:**
    *   The easiest way to connect your Flutter app to Firebase is by using the [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli).
    *   Follow the official documentation to install and use the FlutterFire CLI.

## ü§î Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to solve them.

### `flutter` command not found

*   **Symptom:** You get a `bash: flutter: command not found` error in your terminal.
*   **Cause:** The Flutter SDK is not in your `PATH`.
*   **Solution:** Make sure you have added `export PATH="$PATH:/opt/flutter/bin"` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file and that you have sourced it.

### Android Emulator Issues

*   **Emulator not starting or running slowly:**
    *   **Symptom:** The emulator fails to start or is very laggy.
    *   **Cause:** KVM may not be set up correctly.
    *   **Solution:** Follow the [Arch Wiki guide for KVM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KVM) to ensure it's properly installed and configured. You may also need to enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS/UEFI.

*   **"PANIC: Broken AVD system path" error:**
    *   **Symptom:** The emulator fails to start with this error.
    *   **Cause:** The Android emulator is looking for system images in the wrong location.
    *   **Solution:** Create a symbolic link from the correct location:
        ```bash
        ln -s /opt/android-sdk/system-images/ ~/.android/avd/
        ```

### `flutter doctor` Issues

*   **"Android licenses not accepted" error:**
    *   **Symptom:** `flutter doctor` shows an error about Android licenses.
    *   **Solution:** Run `flutter doctor --android-licenses` and accept all the licenses.

*   **"Unable to locate Android SDK" error:**
    *   **Symptom:** `flutter doctor` can't find the Android SDK.
    *   **Solution:** Make sure you have installed the Android SDK through Android Studio. You can also set the `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
        ```bash
        export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="/opt/android-sdk"
        ```

### Build and Run Issues

*   **Gradle issues:**
    *   **Symptom:** The build fails with a Gradle-related error.
    *   **Cause:** This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as a corrupted Gradle cache or a network issue.
    *   **Solution:** Try cleaning the project with `flutter clean` and then running `flutter run` again. You can also try deleting the `~/.gradle` directory to clear the cache.

*   **"Could not find an option named "null-safety"" error:**
    *   **Symptom:** The build fails with this error.
    *   **Cause:** You are using an older version of Flutter.
    *   **Solution:** Upgrade Flutter to the latest version with `flutter upgrade`.
